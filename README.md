The Energy Information Administration Agency (EIA) is a critical source of data in the Energy Industry. Indeed, according to a Citadel Commodities Quant, if one has EIA data, then one should use EIA data. 

For Natural Gas, the analytics/information derivied from EIA data combined/correlated with Weather Data are very important and a core component of a energy's fund investment strategy. 

However, while the discussion and documentation of EIA Data is highly rigorous, the documentation and discussion of the derived analytics is less well documented/discussed/benchmarked. 

Similar to how the technology/AI industry has significant benchmarks for AI model performance, this codebase aims to be (a) framework for running/benchmakring Natural Gas Analytics where the weather data that
is used is configurable and (b) a set of base models are provided (non-weather historical based model, weather based model etc), (c) the ability for the Natural Gas Trading Community/Enthusiasts to develop high
quality community that rivals closed-source investment processes found at funds. 

Indeed if the open source models replace the closed source models, the Natural Gas Trading Industry will become more efficient and will require higher analytical capability. For a fund to be competetive it will be
forced to compete with the open source models.
